## Run

### Dependencies

The code was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS. Therefore, the system must be able to run BASH scripts.

Java 8 and Scala 2.11+ must be installed in the system. The system should a have `java`, `scala`, and `scalac` available in the environment PATH variable.



For Ubuntu, run the following code to install scala:

`sudo apt-get install scala`

### Instructions

Edit the `run.sh` if you want to change the names of the input and output files.

In a terminal, run the bash script:

`./run.sh`
